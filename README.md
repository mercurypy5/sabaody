The Effect of Exercise on the Homeostasis

Aim

To investigate the mechanisms the human body uses to maintain homeostasis while exercising.

Rationale

(~200 words)

The body has several mechanisms it enforces to maintain homeostasis during exercise. Homeostasis is the "ability of an organism to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in external conditions." ." (Helmenstine, 2025) During exercise, external factors cause changes to occur in the body to enhance the body's performance. In the investigation conducted, the duration of exercise is altered and the body's blood oxygen saturation and pulse are measured before, during and after exercise to track the body's response to maintain homeostasis. By measuring the percentage of blood oxygen saturation and the number of beats/second in the pulse, the data can be analysed to answer to what extent does the duration of exercise impact blood oxygen saturation and pulse.

Leadership is different from nanagement as being Leaders he/she has the skill to lead. Management means achieving organizational goals in an effective and efficient way (Daft & Pirola-Merlo, 2009). On the other hand,

To what extent does the duration of exercise affect the blood oxygen saturation and heart rate and how does the

bodies response help in maintaining homeostasis?

Hypothesis

It is hypothesized that the longer the duration of exercise is, the greater the increase in heart rate and decrease in blood oxygen saturation levels.

Method

The blood oxygen saturation and pulse was measured at rest with a pulse oximeter. The subject then began exercising by doing jumping jacks for 3 minutes with their blood oxygen saturation and pulse measured every 30 seconds. The subject then ceased to exercise and their blood oxygen saturation and pulse was measured was for the next 2 minutes every 30 seconds.
Analysis of data

Figure 1 shows how pulse is affected as exercise is conducted. There is an immediate relationship between the pulse and exercise as before jumping jacks are started, the pulse is recorded at an average of 60 beats/minute however, after 3 minutes of jumping jacks, the pulse increases and is recorded at an average of 110 beats/minute. This direct correlation suggests that the longer the duration of the exercise the greater the pulse increases. This is further supported as after the subject stops doing jumping jacks, the pulse decreases from averages of 110/bpm to 80 beats/minute after 2 minutes of rest. This evidence demonstrates shows

The heart rate increases to support homeostasis. For the body to conduct exercise it requires cellular respiration to move the body. This process requires oxygen as the formula for cellular respiration transforms glucose and oxygen into carbon dioxide, water and energy. (BioExplorer.net, 2025) The heart is responsible for pumping oxygen-rich blood throughout the body; therefore, the pulse increases to support the body with more oxygen required during exercise.

Figure 2 displays the blood oxygen saturation levels as the investigation is conducted. There is a definite relationship between the duration of exercise and blood oxygen. During rest, the oxygen saturation is recorded at an average of 98% which immediately drops to an average of 97.2% in the first 30 seconds of exercise and progressively increases until it reaches 98.5% at the 1 and ½ minute mark, resulting in a positive correlation. This is an expected response as initially, with increased physical demand, the body's oxygen level should decrease to compensate for more cellular respiration. Afterwards, the data in Table 3 and Figure 2 suggests the subject's body tries to maintain homeostasis by increasing the blood oxygen saturation from 97.2% to 98.5%. This process is further supported as being a direct example of homeostasis as after the body maintains homeostasis, the negative feedback loop ensures balance is maintained by decreasing the blood oxygen saturation from 98.5% at 1 & ½ minutes to 98% in the next 1 & ½

minutes.

As for anomalies, as seen in Figure 4, the pulse had a degree of fluctuation particularly when nearing the end of the investigation. During Trial 4, when measuring the heart rate of the subject's heart rate after 1 minute thirty second after ceasing to perform jumping jacks for 3 minutes, it was recorded at 94 beats/minute and thirty seconds later, was recorded at 92 beats/minute. This figure is significantly different from other outcomes like 76, 77 and 79 at the 4 minute and 30 second mark and outcomes like 71, 76 and 81 at the 5 minute mark respectively. In Table 3, 3. t the range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, are recorded at 18 and 21. These anomalies could be due to external factors such as the environment the investigation was conducted in, whether it

Analyse the results to identify trends, patterns or relationships, and any anomalies in the data. Justify your analysis by referring to the data - state numerical values in your text as evidence (do not just write "as seen in Figure 1"). Explain the trends, patterns or relationships, and any anomalies observed during and after exercise. Did all factors change in the same way or at equal rates? How do these factors relate to the research question and mechanisms
